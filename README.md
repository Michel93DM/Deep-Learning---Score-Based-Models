# Deep-Learning---Score-Based Models
This project is caried in the course of Deep Learning at ENSAE 2022-2023
And it is realized by Clement Torres and Michel Daher Mansour. 

You can find here in each jupyter file a model corresponding to GAN, WGAN-GP, DC-GAN or SDEs score-base model.

In this work, we apply Song et al. (2021) method to
train a score based model and then apply some sampling methods to generate new images using the FashionMNIST dataset, using hyperparameters that have found to be most effective by Song et al. (2021). We also test some GANs models on CIFAR10 images  to compare our scores with those of Song et al. (2021) in terms of FID metrics.
